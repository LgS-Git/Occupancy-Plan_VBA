An Occupancy Plan for a care facility.
The Template is able to create the occupancy plan for every year and for each room configuration inside the care facilities stations.

After executing the Template, the specified plan is created and can be automatically filled/changed via Buttons.
The Template stays unchanged and can be used to create different plans going forward.

To avoid downloading the Excel File, the VBA-Code can be reviewed within the 'VBA Code' directory.
